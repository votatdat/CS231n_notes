Understanding of this process and its subtleties is critical for you to understand, and effectively develop, design and debug neural networks.\n",

    "**Problem statement.** The core problem studied in this section is as follows: \n",
    "- We are given some function $f(x)$ where $x$ is a vector of inputs. \n",
    "- We are interested in computing the gradient of $f$ at $x$ (i.e. $\\nabla f(x)$)."

    "**Motivation.** Recall that the primary reason we are interested in this problem is that in the specific case of neural networks:\n",
    "- $f$ will correspond to the loss function ($L$). \n",
    "- The inputs $x$ will consist of the `training data` and the `neural network weights`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- The loss could be the SVM loss function.\n",
    "- The inputs are both the training data $(x_i,y_i), i=1 \\ldots N$  and the weights and biases $W, b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that (as is usually the case in Machine Learning) we think of:\n",
    "- The training data as given and fixed.\n",
    "- The weights as variables we have control over. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, even though we can easily use backpropagation to compute the gradient on the input examples $x_i$, in practice we usually only compute the gradient for the parameters (e.g. $W,b$) so that we can use it to perform a parameter update. \n",
    "<br>However, as we will see later in the class the gradient on $x_i$ can still be useful sometimes, for example for purposes of visualization and interpreting what the Neural Network might be doing.\n",

    "If you are coming to this class and you’re comfortable with deriving gradients with chain rule, we would still like to encourage you to at least skim this section, since it presents a rarely developed view of backpropagation as backward flow in real-valued circuits and any insights you’ll gain may help you throughout the class."

    "<br>Instead, this notation indicates that the operator $\\frac{d}{dx}$ is being applied to the function $f$, and returns a different function (the derivative). \n",
    "<br>A nice way to think about the expression above is that when $h$ is very small, then the function is well-approximated by a straight line, and the derivative is its slope. \n",
    "<br>In other words, the derivative on each variable tells you the sensitivity of the whole expression on its value. \n",

This tells us that if we were to increase the value of this variable by a tiny amount, the effect on the whole expression would be to decrease it (due to the negative sign), and by three times that amount. This can be seen by rearranging the above equation ($f(x + h) = f(x) + h \\frac{df(x)}{dx}$). \n",
    "<br>Analogously, since $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 4$, we expect that increasing the value of $y$ by some very small amount $h$ would also increase the output of the function (due to the positive sign), and by $4h$."

    "As mentioned, the gradient $\\nabla f$ is the vector of partial derivatives, so we have that $\\nabla f = [\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}] = [y, x]$. Even though the gradient is technically a vector, we will often use terms such as *\"the gradient on x\"* instead of the technically correct phrase *\"the partial derivative on x\"* for simplicity.\n",

    "\n",
    "that is, the derivative on both $x,y$ is 1 regardless of what the values of $x,y$ are. This makes sense, since increasing either $x,y$ would increase the output of $f$, and the rate of that increase would be independent of what the actual values of $x,y$ are (unlike the case of multiplication above). The last function we’ll use quite a bit in the class is the max operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x,y) = \\max(x, y) \\hspace{0.5in} \\rightarrow \\hspace{0.5in} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\mathbb{1}(x >= y) \\hspace{0.5in} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\mathbb{1}(y >= x)$$\n",

    "That is, the (sub)gradient is $\\mathbb{1}$ on the input that was larger and 0 on the other input. \n",
    "<br>Intuitively, if the inputs are $x=4,y=2$, then the max is 4, and the function is not sensitive to the setting of $y$. That is, if we were to increase it by a tiny amount $h$, the function would keep outputting $4$, and therefore the gradient is zero: there is no effect. Of course, if we were to change $y$ by a large amount (e.g. larger than 2), then the value of $f$ would change, but the derivatives tell us nothing about the effect of such large changes on the inputs of a function; They are only informative for tiny, infinitesimally small changes on the inputs, as indicated by the $\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}$ in its definition."

    "<br>In particular, note that this expression can be broken down into two expressions: $q=x+y$ and $f=qz$. Moreover, we know how to compute the derivatives of both expressions separately, as seen in the previous section. $f$ is just multiplication of $q$ and $z$, so $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} = z, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = q$, and $q$ is addition of $x$ and $y$ so $\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = 1, \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial y} = 1$. \n",

Instead, we are ultimately interested in the gradient of $f$ with respect to its inputs $x,y,z$. The chain rule tells us that the correct way to “chain” these gradient expressions together is through multiplication.

In practice you want to structure your code so that you cache these variables, and so that they are available during backpropagation. If this is too difficult, it is possible (but wasteful) to recompute them.\n",

The forward expression involves the variables $x,y$ multiple times, so when we perform backpropagation we must be **careful to use += instead of = to accumulate the gradient on these variables** (otherwise we would overwrite it). This follows the multivariable chain rule in Calculus, which states that if a variable branches out to different parts of the circuit, then the gradients that flow back to it will add."

    "- The **add gate** always takes the gradient on its output and **distributes it equally to all of its inputs**, regardless of what their values were during the forward pass. This follows from the fact that the local gradient for the add operation is simply +1.0, so the gradients on all inputs will exactly equal the gradients on the output because it will be multiplied by x1.0 (and remain unchanged). In the example circuit above, note that the + gate routed the gradient of 2.00 to both of its inputs, equally and unchanged.\n",
    "- The **max gate** routes the gradient. Unlike the add gate which distributed the gradient unchanged to all its inputs, the max gate distributes the gradient (unchanged) to **exactly one of its inputs** (the input that had the highest value during the forward pass). This is because the local gradient for a max gate is 1.0 for the highest value, and 0.0 for all other values. In the example circuit above, the max operation routed the gradient of 2.00 to the z variable, which had a higher value than w, and the gradient on w remains zero.\n",
    "- The **multiply gate** is a little less easy to interpret. Its local gradients are the input values (except switched), and this is **multiplied by the gradient on its output** during the chain rule. In the example above, the gradient on $x$ is -8.00, which is -4.00 x 2.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unintuitive effects and their consequences**. \n",
    "- Notice that if one of the inputs to the multiply gate is very small and the other is very big, then the multiply gate will do something slightly unintuitive: it will assign a relatively huge gradient to the small input and a tiny gradient to the large input. \n",
    "- Note that in linear classifiers where the weights are dot producted $w^Tx_i$ (multiplied) with the inputs, this implies that the scale of the data has an effect on the magnitude of the gradient for the weights. For example, if you multiplied all input data examples $x_i$ by 1000 during preprocessing, then the gradient on the weights will be 1000 times larger, and you’d have to lower the learning rate by that factor to compensate. This is why preprocessing matters a lot, sometimes in subtle ways! And having intuitive understanding for how the gradients flow can help you debug some of these cases."

There is always exactly one way of achieving this so that the dimensions work out. For example, X is of size \\[10 x 3\\] and `dD` of size \\[5 x 3\\], so if we want dW and `W` has shape \\[5 x 10\\], then the only way of achieving this is with `dD.dot(X.T)`, as shown above.\n",

You always want to break up your function into modules for which you can easily derive local gradients, and then chain them with chain rule. Crucially, you almost never want to write out these expressions on paper and differentiate them symbolically in full, because you never need an explicit mathematical equation for the gradient of the input variables. Hence, decompose your expressions into stages such that you can differentiate every stage independently (the stages will be matrix vector multiplies, or max operations, or sum operations, etc.) and then backprop through the variables one step at a time.\n",
