    "A last piece of terminology we’ll mention before we finish with this section is that the threshold at zero `max(0, −) function` is often called the **hinge loss**. You'll sometimes hear about people instead using the **`squared hinge loss SVM`** (or `L2-SVM`), which uses the form $max(0,−)^2$ that penalizes violated margins more strongly (quadratically instead of linearly). The unsquared version is more standard, but in some datasets the squared hinge loss can work better. This can be determined during `cross-validation`."

    "<br>The issue is that this set of $W$ is **not necessarily unique**: there might be many similar $W$ that correctly classify the examples. One easy way to see this is that if some parameters $W$ correctly classify all examples (so loss is zero for each example), then any multiple of these parameters $\\lambda W$ where $\\lambda > 1$ will also give zero loss because this transformation uniformly stretches all score magnitudes and hence also their absolute differences. \n",
