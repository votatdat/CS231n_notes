    "**In practice, SVM and Softmax are usually comparable.** The performance difference between the SVM and Softmax are **usually very small**, and different people will have different opinions on which classifier works better. \n",

    "Compared to the Softmax classifier, the SVM is a more **local objective**, which could be thought of either as a bug or a feature. Consider an example that achieves the scores \\[10, -2, 3\\] and where the first class is correct. An SVM (e.g. with desired margin of $\\Delta = 1$) will see that the correct class already has a score higher than the margin compared to the other classes and it will compute loss of zero. The SVM does not care about the details of the individual scores: if they were instead \\[10, -100, -100\\] or \\[10, 9, 9\\] the SVM would be indifferent since the margin of 1 is satisfied and hence the loss is zero. \n",

    "However, these scenarios are not equivalent to a Softmax classifier, which would accumulate a much higher loss for the scores \\[10, 9, 9\\] than for \\[10, -100, -100\\]. In other words, the Softmax classifier is **never fully happy with the scores it produces**: the correct class could always have a higher probability and the incorrect classes always a lower probability and the loss would always get better. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the SVM is happy once the margins are satisfied and it does not micromanage the exact scores beyond this constraint. This can intuitively be thought of as a feature: For example, a car classifier which is likely spending most of its \"effort\" on the difficult problem of separating cars from trucks should not be influenced by the frog examples, which it already assigns very low scores to, and which likely cluster around a completely different side of the data cloud."

    "- We defined a **`score function`** from image pixels to **class scores** (in this section, a linear function that depends on weights $W$ and biases $b$).\n",
    "- Unlike kNN classifier, the advantage of this **parametric approach** is that once we learn the parameters we can discard the training data. Additionally, the prediction for a new test image is fast since it requires a single matrix multiplication with $W$, not an exhaustive comparison to every single training example.\n",
    "- We introduced the **bias trick**, which allows us to fold the bias vector into the weight matrix for convenience of only having to keep track of one parameter matrix.\n",
    "- We defined a **`loss function`** (we introduced two commonly used losses for linear classifiers: the SVM and the Softmax) that measures how compatible a given set of parameters is with respect to the ground truth labels in the training dataset. We also saw that the loss function was defined in such way that making good predictions on the training data is equivalent to having a small loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now saw one way to take a dataset of images and map each one to class scores based on a set of parameters, and we saw two examples of loss functions that we can use to measure the quality of the predictions. But how do we efficiently determine the parameters that give the best (lowest) loss? This process is **optimization**, and it is the topic of the next section."
