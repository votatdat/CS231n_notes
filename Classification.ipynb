    "**Motivation.** In this section we will introduce the Image Classification problem, which is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications. Moreover, as we will see later in the course, many other seemingly distinct Computer Vision tasks (such as object detection, segmentation) can be reduced to image classification."

    "**Challenges**. Since this task of recognizing a visual concept (e.g. cat) is relatively trivial for a human to perform, it is worth considering the challenges involved from the perspective of a Computer Vision algorithm. As we present (an inexhaustive) list of challenges below, keep in mind the **raw representation of images as a 3-D array of brightness values**:\n",
    "- **Viewpoint variation**. A single instance of an object can be oriented in many ways with respect to the camera.\n",
    "- **Scale variation**. Visual classes often exhibit variation in their size (size in the real world, not only in terms of their extent in the image).\n",
    "- **Deformation**. Many objects of interest are not rigid bodies and can be deformed in extreme ways.\n",
    "- **Occlusion**. The objects of interest can be occluded. Sometimes only a small portion of an object (as little as few pixels) could be visible.\n",
    "- **Illumination conditions**. The effects of illumination are drastic on the pixel level.\n",
    "- **Background clutter**. The objects of interest may blend into their environment, making them hard to identify.\n",
    "- **Intra-class variation**. The classes of interest can often be relatively broad, such as chair. There are many different types of these objects, each with their own appearance."

    "<br/>Unlike writing an algorithm for, for example, sorting a list of numbers, it is not obvious how one might write an algorithm for identifying cats in images. Therefore, instead of trying to specify what every one of the categories of interest look like directly in code, the approach that we will take is not unlike one you would take with a child: we’re going to provide the computer with many examples of each class and then develop learning algorithms that look at these examples and learn about the visual appearance of each class. This approach is referred to as a **data-driven approach**, since it relies on first **accumulating a training dataset of labeled images**. Here is an example of what such a dataset might look like:"
