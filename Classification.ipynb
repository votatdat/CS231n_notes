This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications. Moreover, as we will see later in the course, many other seemingly distinct Computer Vision tasks (such as object detection, segmentation) can be reduced to image classification."

Since this task of recognizing a visual concept (e.g. cat) is relatively trivial for a human to perform, it is worth considering the challenges involved from the perspective of a Computer Vision algorithm. As we present (an inexhaustive) list of challenges below, keep in mind the **raw representation of images as a 3-D array of brightness values**:\n",
    "- **Viewpoint variation**. A single instance of an object can be oriented in many ways with respect to the camera.\n",
    "- **Scale variation**. Visual classes often exhibit variation in their size (size in the real world, not only in terms of their extent in the image).\n",
    "- **Deformation**. Many objects of interest are not rigid bodies and can be deformed in extreme ways.\n",
    "- **Occlusion**. The objects of interest can be occluded. Sometimes only a small portion of an object (as little as few pixels) could be visible.\n",
    "- **Illumination conditions**. The effects of illumination are drastic on the pixel level.\n",

We saw that there are multiple hyper-parameters (such as value of k, or the type of distance used to compare examples) that are associated with this classifier and that there was no obvious way of choosing them.\n",

We will cover this in more detail in later sections, and chose not to cover data normalization in this section because pixels in images are usually homogeneous and do not exhibit widely different distributions, alleviating the need for data normalization.\n",

If your data is very high-dimensional, consider using a dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA ([wiki ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), [CS229ref](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes10.pdf), [blog ref](https://web.archive.org/web/20150503165118/http://www.bigdataexaminer.com:80/understanding-dimensionality-reduction-principal-component-analysis-and-singular-value-decomposition/)), NCA ([wiki ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_components_analysis), [blog ref](https://kevinzakka.github.io/2020/02/10/nca/)), or even [Random Projections](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/random_projection.html).\n",
    "3. Split your training data randomly into train/val splits. As a rule of thumb, between 70-90% of your data usually goes to the train split. This setting depends on how many hyperparameters you have and how much of an influence you expect them to have. If there are many hyperparameters to estimate, you should err on the side of having larger validation set to estimate them effectively. If you are concerned about the size of your validation data, it is best to split the training data into folds and perform cross-validation. If you can afford the computational budget it is always safer to go with cross-validation (the more folds the better, but more expensive).\n",
    "4. Train and evaluate the kNN classifier on the validation data (for all folds, if doing cross-validation) for many choices of k (e.g. the more the better) and across different distance types (L1 and L2 are good candidates)\n",

    "6. Take note of the hyperparameters that gave the best results. There is a question of whether you should use the full training set with the best hyperparameters, since the optimal hyperparameters might change if you were to fold the validation data into your training set (since the size of the data would be larger). In practice it is cleaner to not use the validation data in the final classifier and consider it to be burned on estimating the hyperparameters. Evaluate the best model on the test set. Report the test set accuracy and declare the result to be the performance of the kNN classifier on your data."
