    "`Convolutional Neural Networks` are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks from the previous chapter: \n",
    "- They are made up of neurons that have learnable `weights` and `biases`. \n",
    "- Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. \n",
    "- The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. \n",
    "-They have a loss function (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (`fully-connected`) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural Networks still apply.\n",

    "**Recall: Regular Neural Nets**. \n",
    "- Neural Networks receive an input (a single vector), and transform it through a series of hidden layers. \n",
    "- Each hidden layer is made up of a set of neurons, where each neuron is *fully connected* to all neurons in the previous layer, and where neurons in a single layer function completely independently and do not share any connections. \n",
    "- The last `fully-connected` layer is called the “output layer” and in classification settings it represents the class scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Neural Nets don’t scale well to full images**. In CIFAR-10, images are only of size 32x32x3 (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular Neural Network would have 32*32*3 = 3072 weights. This amount still seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable size, e.g. 200x200x3, would lead to neurons that have 200*200*3 = 120,000 weights. Moreover, we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons, so the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly, **this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3D volumes of neurons**. Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more sensible way. In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.) \n",
    "<br>For example, the input images in CIFAR-10 are an input volume of activations, and the volume has dimensions 32x32x3 (width, height, depth respectively). As we will soon see, the neurons in a layer will only be **connected to a small region of the layer before it**, instead of all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. \n",
    "<br>Moreover, the final output layer would for CIFAR-10 have dimensions 1x1x10, because by the end of the ConvNet architecture we will reduce the full image into a single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth dimension. "

    "**Overview and intuition without brain stuff.**\n",
    "<br>Let’s first discuss what the CONV layer computes without brain/neuron analogies. \n",
    "- The CONV layer's parameters consist of a set of learnable filters. \n",
    "- Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "- A typical filter on a first layer of a ConvNet might have size 5x5x3 (i.e. 5 pixels width and height, and 3 because images have depth 3, the color channels). \n",
    "- During the forward pass, we slide (more precisely, convolve) each filter across the width and height of the input volume and compute dot products between the entries of the filter and the input at any position. \n",
    "- As we slide the filter over the width and height of the input volume, we will produce a 2-dimensional activation map that gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. \n",
    "- Intuitively, the network will learn filters that activate when they see some type of visual feature such as an edge of some orientation or a blotch of some color on the first layer, or eventually entire honeycomb or wheel-like patterns on higher layers of the network. \n",
    "- Now, we will have an entire set of filters in each CONV layer (e.g. 12 filters), and each of them will produce a separate 2-dimensional activation map. We will stack these activation maps along the depth dimension and produce the output volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The brain view.** \n",
    "<br>If you’re a fan of the brain/neuron analogies, every entry in the 3D output volume can also be interpreted as an output of a neuron that looks at only a small region in the input and shares parameters with all neurons to the left and right spatially (since these numbers all result from applying the same filter). We now discuss the details of the neuron connectivities, their arrangement in space, and their parameter sharing scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Connectivity.**\n",
    "<br>When dealing with high-dimensional inputs such as images, as we saw above it is impractical to connect neurons to all neurons in the previous volume. \n",
    "<br>Instead, we will connect each neuron to only **a local region** of the input volume. The spatial extent of this connectivity is a hyperparameter called the **receptive field of the neuron** (equivalently this is the filter size). The extent of the connectivity along the depth axis is always equal to the depth of the input volume. It is important to emphasize again this asymmetry in how we treat the spatial dimensions (width and height) and the depth dimension: The connections are local in space (along width and height), but always full along the entire depth of the input volume."
