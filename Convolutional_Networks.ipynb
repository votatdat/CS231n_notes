    "- Neural Networks receive an input (a single vector), and transform it through a series of hidden layers. \n",
    "- Each hidden layer is made up of a set of neurons, where each neuron is *fully connected* to all neurons in the previous layer, and where neurons in a single layer function completely independently and do not share any connections. \n",
    "- The last `fully-connected` layer is called the “output layer” and in classification settings it represents the class scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Neural Nets don’t scale well to full images**. In CIFAR-10, images are only of size 32x32x3 (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular Neural Network would have `32*32*3 = 3072` weights. This amount still seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable size, e.g. 200x200x3, would lead to neurons that have `200*200*3 = 120,000` weights. \n",
    "<br>Moreover, we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons, so the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly, **this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting**.\n",

    "<br>In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third dimension of an **activation volume**, not to the depth of a full Neural Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.) \n",
    "<br>For example, the input images in CIFAR-10 are an input volume of activations, and the volume has dimensions 32x32x3 (width, height, depth respectively). As we will soon see, the neurons in a layer will only be **connected to a small region of the layer before it**, instead of all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. \n",
    "<br>Moreover, the final output layer would for CIFAR-10 have dimensions 1x1x10, because by the end of the ConvNet architecture we will reduce the full image into a single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth dimension. "

    "1. First, **`the depth`** of the output volume is a hyperparameter: it corresponds to the number of filters we would like to use, each learning to look for something different in the input. For example, if the first Convolutional Layer takes as input the raw image, then different neurons along the depth dimension may activate in presence of various oriented edges, or blobs of color. We will refer to a set of neurons that are all looking at the same region of the input as a **depth column** (some people also prefer the term *`fibre`*).\n",

When the stride is 2 (or uncommonly 3 or more, though this is rare in practice) then the filters jump 2 pixels at a time as we slide them around. This will produce smaller output volumes spatially.\n",
