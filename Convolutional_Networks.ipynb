    "- Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. \n",
    "- The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. \n",

    "**Recall: Regular Neural Nets**. \n",
    "- Neural Networks receive an input (a single vector), and transform it through a series of hidden layers. \n",
    "- Each hidden layer is made up of a set of neurons, where each neuron is *fully connected* to all neurons in the previous layer, and where neurons in a single layer function completely independently and do not share any connections. \n",
    "- The last `fully-connected` layer is called the “output layer” and in classification settings it represents the class scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Neural Nets don’t scale well to full images**. In CIFAR-10, images are only of size 32x32x3 (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular Neural Network would have `32*32*3 = 3072` weights. This amount still seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable size, e.g. 200x200x3, would lead to neurons that have `200*200*3 = 120,000` weights. \n",
    "<br>Moreover, we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons, so the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly, **this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3D volumes of neurons**. Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more sensible way. \n",
    "<br>In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third dimension of an **activation volume**, not to the depth of a full Neural Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.) \n",
    "<br>For example, the input images in CIFAR-10 are an input volume of activations, and the volume has dimensions 32x32x3 (width, height, depth respectively). As we will soon see, the neurons in a layer will only be **connected to a small region of the layer before it**, instead of all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. \n",
    "<br>Moreover, the final output layer would for CIFAR-10 have dimensions 1x1x10, because by the end of the ConvNet architecture we will reduce the full image into a single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth dimension. "

    "1. First, **`the depth`** of the output volume is a hyperparameter: it corresponds to the number of filters we would like to use, each learning to look for something different in the input. For example, if the first Convolutional Layer takes as input the raw image, then different neurons along the depth dimension may activate in presence of various oriented edges, or blobs of color. We will refer to a set of neurons that are all looking at the same region of the input as a **depth column** (some people also prefer the term *`fibre`*).\n",
    "2. Second, we must specify the **`stride`** with which we slide the filter. When the stride is 1 then we move the filters one pixel at a time. When the stride is 2 (or uncommonly 3 or more, though this is rare in practice) then the filters jump 2 pixels at a time as we slide them around. This will produce smaller output volumes spatially.\n",
    "3. As we will soon see, sometimes it will be convenient to **pad the input volume with zeros around the border**. The size of this **`zero-padding`** is a hyperparameter. The nice feature of zero padding is that it will allow us to control the spatial size of the output volumes (most commonly as we’ll see soon we will use it to exactly preserve the spatial size of the input volume so the input and output width and height are the same)."

This is especially the case when the input images to a ConvNet have some specific centered structure, where we should expect, for example, that completely different features should be learned on one side of the image than another. One practical example is when the input are faces that have been centered in the image. You might expect that different eye-specific or hair-specific features could (and should) be learned in different spatial locations. In that case it is common to relax the parameter sharing scheme, and instead simply call the layer a **Locally-Connected Layer**."

A common implementation pattern of the CONV layer is to take advantage of this fact and formulate the forward pass of a convolutional layer as one big matrix multiply as follows:\n",
    "1. The local regions in the input image are stretched out into columns in an operation commonly called **im2col**. For example, if the input is \\[227x227x3\\] and it is to be convolved with 11x11x3 filters at stride 4, then we would take \\[11x11x3\\] blocks of pixels in the input and stretch each block into a column vector of size 11\\*11\\*3 = 363. Iterating this process in the input at stride of 4 gives (227-11)/4+1 = 55 locations along both width and height, leading to an output matrix `X_col` of *im2col* of size \\[363 x 3025\\], where every column is a stretched out receptive field and there are 55\\*55 = 3025 of them in total. Note that since the receptive fields overlap, every number in the input volume may be duplicated in multiple distinct columns.\n",
    "2. The weights of the CONV layer are similarly stretched out into rows. For example, if there are 96 filters of size \\[11x11x3\\] this would give a matrix `W_row` of size \\[96 x 363\\].\n",
    "3. The result of a convolution is now equivalent to performing one large matrix multiply `np.dot(W_row, X_col)`, which evaluates the dot product between every filter and every receptive field location. In our example, the output of this operation would be \\[96 x 3025\\], giving the output of the dot product of each filter at each location.\n",
    "4. The result must finally be reshaped back to its proper output dimension \\[55x55x96\\].\n",
