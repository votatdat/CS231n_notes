    "**Manhattan Distance** is extremely similar to Euclidean distance. Rather than summing the squared difference between each dimension, we instead sum the absolute value of the difference between each dimension. It’s called Manhattan distance because it’s similar to how you might navigate when walking city blocks. If you’ve ever wondered “how many blocks will it take me to get from point A to point B”, you’ve computed the Manhattan distance.\n",

Rather than summing the number of differences in dimensions, this implementation sums those differences and then divides by the total number of dimensions. For example, in your implementation, the Hamming distance between \\[1, 2, 3\\] and \\[7, 2, -10\\] would be 2. In scipy‘s version, it would be 2/3."
