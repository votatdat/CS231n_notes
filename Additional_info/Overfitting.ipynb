    "Often in Machine Learning, we feed a huge amount of data to an algorithm that then learns how to classify that input based on rules it creates. The data we feed into this algorithm, the training data, is hugely important. The rules created by the program will be determined by looking at every example in the training data.\n",

    "## 3. Try to Augment the Training Data\n",
    "In our [Bayes’ Theorem](https://www.codecademy.com/content-items/67dba901393541693a95b927d62b9842/exercises/intro) lesson we discussed that when we have a small total number of an event, this will affect how reliably we can guess if the event will occur. Many systems built to detect fraud suffer from this problem. Suppose we were creating a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card activity. On the aggregate, there are very few fraudulent transactions, so the model can reach a very high accuracy by simply predicting that every transaction is legitimate. This approach would not solve our problem very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "One technique is to identify a fraudulent transaction and make many copies of it in the training set, with small variations in the feature data. We can imagine that if our training set has only 2 examples of fraud, the algorithm will overfit to only identify a transaction as fraudulent if it has the exact characteristics of those couple of examples. When we augment the training data with more fraudulent examples, mildly altered from the ones we know, we reduce the amount of overfitting.\n",

    "Data augmentation is used most often in image classification techniques. Often, we add copies of each picture with an added rotation, shearing, or color jittering.\n",

    "## 4. Try Restricting the Featureset\n",
    "If one of your features is more heavily affecting the parameters of the model, try to run your model without that feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say you are writing a program to determine if someone’s loan application should be accepted or rejected. Your model shows that the most significant variable is their race — with all other features the same, the model has a much higher chance of producing an “accept” prediction on an application from a white applicant than on a non-white applicant. This parameter weight may be a sign that the training data contained racial bias. We can try to train the model again, with the race data removed from the featureset."

    "## 5. Reflection\n",
    "Machine Learning algorithms always must introduce a bias as a function of being programs that are trying to make assumptions and rules by looking at data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the best way to deal with the introduction of bias in a training set is to just acknowledge that it is there. As we try to compensate for the bias, our methods of compensation themselves introduce a bias. It is important to find a balance. The most important thing is to mention the existence of bias in your results, and make sure that all stakeholders know that it exists, so that it is taken into consideration with the decisions made from your model’s results."
