    "In the previous section we introduced *two key components* in context of the image classification task:\n",
    "- A (parameterized) **`score function`** mapping the raw image pixels to class scores (e.g. a linear function)\n",
    "- A **`loss function`** that measured the quality of a particular set of parameters based on how well the induced scores agreed with the ground truth labels in the training data. We saw that there are many ways and versions of this (e.g. Softmax/SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, recall that the linear function had the form $f(x_i, W) =  W x_i$ and the SVM we developed was formulated as:\n",

    "$$L = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\sum_{j\\neq y_i} \\left[ \\max(0, f(x_i; W)_j - f(x_i; W)_{y_i} + 1) \\right] + \\alpha R(W)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that a setting of the parameters $W$ that produced predictions for examples $x_i$ consistent with their ground truth labels $y_i$ would also have a very low loss $L$. We are now going to introduce the third and last key component: **optimization**. Optimization is the process of finding the set of parameters $W$ that **minimize the loss function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreshadowing**: Once we understand how these three core components interact, we will revisit the first component (the parameterized function mapping) and extend it to functions much more complicated than a linear mapping: First entire Neural Networks, and then Convolutional Neural Networks. The loss functions and the optimization process will remain relatively unchanged."

To see this, consider the extreme case where all 1.2 million images in ILSVRC are in fact made up of exact duplicates of only 1000 unique images (one for each class, or in other words 1200 identical copies of each image). Then it is clear that the gradients we would compute for all 1200 identical copies would all be the same, and when we average the data loss over all 1.2 million images we would get the exact same loss as if we only evaluated on a small subset of 1000. In practice of course, the dataset would not contain duplicate images, the gradient from a mini-batch is a **good approximation** of the gradient of the full objective.

    "The extreme case of this is a setting where the mini-batch contains only a single example. This process is called **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** (or also sometimes **on-line** gradient descent). This is relatively **less common** to see because in practice due to vectorized code optimizations it can be computationally much more efficient to evaluate the gradient for 100 examples, than the gradient for one example 100 times. Even though SGD technically refers to using a single example at a time to evaluate the gradient, you will hear people use the term SGD even when referring to mini-batch gradient descent (i.e. mentions of MGD for “Minibatch Gradient Descent”, or BGD for “Batch gradient descent” are rare to see), where it is usually assumed that mini-batches are used. The size of the mini-batch is a hyperparameter but it is not very common to cross-validate it. It is usually based on memory constraints (if any), or set to some value, e.g. 32, 64 or 128. We use powers of 2 in practice because many vectorized operation implementations work faster when their inputs are sized in powers of 2."
